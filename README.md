# MATLAB CMex Templates
The three basic structures of MATLAB Simulink's CMex program for Control System programming and simulation.

- Structure A: For basic input-output function block.
- Structure B: For discrete (variable update-based calculation) function block.
- Structure C: For continuous (derivate-based calculation) function block.
