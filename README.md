# MATLAB CMex Templates
 The three basic structures of MATLAB Simulink's CMex program for Control System programming and simulation. Structure A is for basic input-output function block. Structure B is for discrete (variable update-based calculation) function block. And structure C is for continuous (derivate-based calculation) function block.
